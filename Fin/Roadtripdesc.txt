You are going on a roadtrip with a few friends. Instead of using one of the easy to use roadtrip websites, you decide to program your own system.

Your awesome program must support an "unlimited" number of stops. Each stop should have a descriptive name and the distance in miles from the last stop.

For example, the first stop might be Philadelphia with a distance of 15 miles, if we assume we start at Rowan. The next stop might be Pittsburgh with a distance of 300 miles. 
The total distance from Rowan to Pittsburgh is 315 miles, but we only worry about distances between stops.

Additionally, you program must support the following use cases:
* a user wants to know what the Xth stop is
* a user wants to remove a stop (this should also update the mileage... if I removed Philadelphia, the distance to Pittsburgh should be updated to 315)
		This may be a problem
* a user wants to know the total mileage, total # of stops, mileage between two arbitrary stops
* a user certainly doesn't want memory leaks
I'm not placing any constraints on your implementation other than the stops must be stored in a linked list. Further, templates are NOT required.

You need to turn in all classes you create and a test program that creates a few stops and demonstrates all the use cases.

Hints:
* you could just use a templated linked list from the book with a stop class you make
* or you might want to create your own node with the stop information built in

NOTES FOR YOU:

-	My distance is just assigned by the length list and no specific distance is assigned to a specific variable
	(i realize I could probably just assign a random value to max but I dont want to)
-	Distance doesnt exactly adjust to the deleted string
-	Some errors may occur if the wrong value is entered, just press continue (the code is relatively harder to break than normal)
-	I apologize for all the if statements

Procedure
1. Enter names of desinations
2. Assign string data length to 'max'
3. Display each destination
4. Ask to see if they want to look at the Xth destination (Force them to do it anyway)
5. Ask for string to delete
6. Delete string		
7. Keep 'max' the same	
8. Display the list
9. Show total distance (will not correspond)


x. Should I re-ask for delete string? Nahhhhhhhh
y. ???
z. Profit
